<h1 style="color: rgb(185, 229, 214); size: 24px; text-align: center;">This is my about!</h1>

<p style="color: rgb(125, 152, 190); size: 18px; text-align: center;">The reason I chose to do this about my life was because I thought that it would be easiest to do, because I have many photos about me and my friends, so it would've been pretty simple to make the image gallery. I like this project because it was centered around my friends, who are some of the most important people in my life, and including my teammates which I know from soccer that's also a really big part of my life, doing this just hit both of those points. This about is going to include some links to things that are important to me, including soccer websites, my friends instagram pages because they want more followers, and so on. This project was really fun for me, and I enjoyed being able to design this website to how I liked it.  </p>
